## Features

- **Allows two players to play against each other**
- **Keeps track of players' scores**
- **Simple and intuitive interface**

## Technologies Used

- **C++ Programming Language:** The core logic of the game is implemented using the C++ programming language.
- **Standard C++ Libraries:** Standard C++ libraries such as <iostream> and <cstdlib> are used for input/output operations and general-purpose functionalities.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** The game is designed to run in a command-line interface, allowing players to interact with the game using text-based commands.
